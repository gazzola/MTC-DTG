 The simplest way to do that is implementing ShellBolt class (I am explaning that on the API section). Storm has a mode for software testing in a single machine. This can be achieved by setting a single working node or with the code submissions method
Apache Maven
Maven is a software project management tool that uses a project oriented model (POM), which is written in XML. It helps to build a jar package that is easy deliverable to nimbus. To use it we use the following command to compile it:
A alternative to maven is the Leiningen, which automates project similarly to Maven but it is written to work with Clojure methods. That way it is possible to write topologies em Clojure and deploy them using:
Network
Every big data system has to worry with two major bottle necks: Network and processing. Storms deal fine with processing bottlenecks. The data parallelism and Zookeeper garantees a good load ddistribution. However, the system doesnt optimize the network usage. The tuples may have different sizes as the comunication between nodes may have different latencies and bandwidth. I believe that there is room for optimizing the network bottleneck by dynamically adjusting the communication based on the link latency and on the network saturation. For instance, if the comunication between two bolts is very intensive in a moment perhabs it is best that both run on the same worker machine. Dependency
The system depends on a bunch of software that may loose compatibility in a long range support. This may be critical to storm project. There are some big data systems that are more stable because they depend on fewer third party software. In this section I am covering simple usages of storm that help to didacally understand how storm work. In here we are working with examples ssen in the storm-starter. The exclamation topology is a very simple topology that has only one objective: Add exclamation marks at the end of random words.
